  o Minor bugfixes (address selection):
    - When the fascist_firewall_choose_address_ functions don't find a
      reachable address, set the returned address to the null address and port.
      This is a precautionary measure, because some callers do not check the
      return value.
      Fixes bug 24736; bugfix on 0.2.8.2-alpha.
