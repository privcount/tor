  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service):
    - Make sure that we have a usable ed25519 key when the intro point relay
      does support ed25519 link authentication. We do check for an empty key
      when the relay does not support it so this makes it nice and symmetric.
      Fixes bug 24002; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
