  o Minor bugfixes (scheduler, KIST):
    - Use a sane write limit for KISTLite when writing onto a connection
      buffer instead of using INT_MAX and shoving as much as it can. Because
      the OOM handler cleans up circuit queues, we are better off at keeping
      them in that queue instead of the connection's buffer. Fixes bug 24671;
      bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
