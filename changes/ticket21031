  o Minor features (removed deprecations):
   - The ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses flag can once again be set in
     non-testing Tor networks, so long as they do not use the default
     directory authorities.
     This change also removes the deprecation of this
     flag in 0.2.9.2-alpha. Closes ticket 21031.
