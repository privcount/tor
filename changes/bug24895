  o Major bugfixes (onion services):
    - Fix an "off by 2" error in counting rendezvous failures on the onion
      service side. While we thought we would stop the rendezvous attempt
      after one failed circuit, we were actually making three circuit attempts
      before giving up. Now switch to a default of 2, and allow the consensus
      parameter "hs_service_max_rdv_failures" to override. Fixes bug 24895;
      bugfix on 0.0.6.
