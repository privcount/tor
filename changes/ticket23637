  o Minor features (directory authority):
    - Make the "Exit" flag assignment only depend on whether the exit
      policy allows connections to ports 80 and 443. Previously relays
      would get the Exit flag if they allowed connections to one of
      these ports and also port 6667. Resolves ticket 23637.
