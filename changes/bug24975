  o Major bugfixes (scheduler, consensus):
    - A logic in the code was preventing the scheduler subystem to properly
      make a decision based on the latest consensus when it arrives. This lead
      to the scheduler failing to notice any consensus parameters that might
      have changed between consensuses. Fixes bug 24975; bugfix on
      0.3.2.1-alpha.
