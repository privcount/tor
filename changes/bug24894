  o Major bugfixes (v3 onion services):
    - New-style (v3) onion services now obey the "max rendezvous circuit
      attempts" logic. Previously they would make as many rendezvous
      circuit attempts as they could fit in the MAX_REND_TIMEOUT second
      window before giving up. Fixes bug 24894; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
