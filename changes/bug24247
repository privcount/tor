  o Minor bugfixes (fuzzing):
    - Fix a bug in our fuzzing mock replacement for crypto_pk_checksig(), to
      correctly handle cases where a caller gives it an RSA key of under 160
      bits. (This is not actually a bug in Tor itself, but wrather in our
      fuzzing code.)  Fixes bug 24247; bugfix on 0.3.0.3-alpha.
      Found by OSS-Fuzz as issue 4177.
