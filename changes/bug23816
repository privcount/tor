  o Minor bugfixes (directory client):
    - On failure to download directory information, delay retry attempts
      by a random amount based on the "decorrelated jitter" algorithm.
      Our previous delay algorithm tended to produce extra-long delays too
      easily. Fixes bug 23816; bugfix on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
