  o Minor bugfixes (logging, relay):
    - Suppress a log notice when relay descriptors arrive. We already have a
      bootstrap progress for this so no need to log notice everytime tor
      receives relay descriptors. Microdescriptors behave the same. Fixes bug
      23861; bugfix on 0.2.8.2-alpha.
