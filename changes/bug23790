  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v2):
    - When reloading tor (HUP) configured with hidden service(s), some
      information weren't copy to the new service object. One problem with
      this was that tor would wait at least the RendPostPeriod time before
      uploading the descriptor if the reload happened before the descriptor
      needed to be published. Fixes bug 23790; bugfix on 0.2.1.9-alpha.
