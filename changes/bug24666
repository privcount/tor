  o Minor bugfixes (memory usage):

    - When queuing DESTROY cells on a channel, only queue the
      circuit-id and reason fields: not the entire 514-byte
      cell. This fix should help mitigate any bugs or attacks that
      fill up these queues, and free more RAM for other uses. Fixes
      bug 24666; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
