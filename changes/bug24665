  o Major bugfixes (KIST, scheduler):
    - The KIST scheduler did not correctly account for data already enqueued
      in each connection's send socket buffer, particularly in cases when the
      TCP/IP congestion window was reduced between scheduler calls. This
      situation lead to excessive per-connection buffering in the kernel, and
      a potential memory DoS. Fixes bug 24665; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
