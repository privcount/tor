  o Minor features (compatibility, OpenSSL):
    - Tor will now support TLS1.3 once OpenSSL 1.1.1 is released.
      Previous versions of Tor would not have worked with OpenSSL
      1.1.1, since they neither disabled TLS 1.3 nor enabled any of the
      ciphersuites it requires. Here we enable the TLS 1.3 ciphersuites.
      Closes ticket 24978.
