  o Minor bugfixes (logging, relay):
    - Downgrade a warning to a protocol warning in the case the ed25519 key is
      not consistent between the descriptor and micro descriptor of a relay.
      This can happen for instance if the relay has been flagged
      NoEdConsensus. Fixes bug 24025; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
