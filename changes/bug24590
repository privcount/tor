  o Minor bugfixes (scheduler, KIST):
    - Avoid a possible integer overflow when computing the available space on
      the TCP buffer of a channel. This has no security implications but can
      make KIST not behave properly by allowing more cells on a already
      saturated connection. Fixes bug 24590; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
