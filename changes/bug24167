  o Minor bugfixes (network layer):
    - When closing a connection via close_connection_immediately(), we
      mark it as "not blocked on bandwidth", to prevent later calls
      from trying to unblock it, and give it permission to read. This
      fixes a backtrace warning that can happen on relays under various
      circumstances. Fixes bug 24167; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
