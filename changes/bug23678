  o Minor bugfixes (warnings):
    - When we get an HTTP request on a SOCKS port, tell the user about
      the new HTTPTunnelPort option. Previously, we would give a
      "Tor is not an HTTP Proxy" message, which stopped being true when
      HTTPTunnelPort was introduced. Fixes bug 23678; bugfix on
      0.3.2.1-alpha.
