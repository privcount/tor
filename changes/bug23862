  o Minor bugfixes (entry guards):
    - Tor now updates its guard state when it reads a consensus regardless of
      whether it's missing descriptors. That makes tor use its primary guards
      to fetch descriptors in some edge cases where it would have used fallback
      directories in the past. Fixes bug 23862; bugfix on 0.3.0.1-alpha.
