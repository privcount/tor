  o Major bugfixes (relays):
    - Fix a set of false positives where relays would consider connections
      to other relays as being client-only connections (and thus e.g.
      deserving different link padding schemes) if those relays fell out
      of the consensus briefly. Now we look only at the initial handshake
      and whether the connection authenticated as a relay. Fixes bug
      24898; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
