  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v3):
    - Fix a race between the circuit close and free where the service would
      launch a new intro circuit after the close, and then fail to register it
      before the free of the previously closed circuit. This was making the
      service unable to find the established intro circuit and thus not upload
      its descriptor. It can make a service unavailable for up to 24 hours.
      Fixes bug 23603; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
