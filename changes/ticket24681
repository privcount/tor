  o Minor features (fallback directory mirrors):
    - Make the default DirAuthorityFallbackRate 0.1, so that clients on the
      public tor network prefer to bootstrap off fallback directory mirrors.
      This is a follow-up to 24679, which removed weights from the default
      fallbacks.
      Implements ticket 24681.
